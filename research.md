## Research Interests
My main research interest is x-ray based 3D imaging of engineering materials, especially using diffraction based techniques.
I am particularly interested in developing and using methods that provide information about individual grains in polycrystalline samples, such as 3DXRD.
I am also interested in more traditional x-ray and/or neutron tomography, especially when combined with in-situ manipulation of the specimen.

Below is a wordcloud generated from the keywords of my publications.
